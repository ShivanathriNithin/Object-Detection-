
ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep. 
You can load a pretrained version of the neural network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database . 
The pretrained neural network can classify images into 1000 object categories, . As a result, the neural network has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of images. 

Advantages:

This enables much faster training of each layer.
which reduces the number of parameters and matrix multiplications.
It uses a stack of three layers rather than two layers.
